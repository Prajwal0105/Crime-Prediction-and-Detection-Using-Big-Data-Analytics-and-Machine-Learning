## An Optimal approach towards Crime Prediction and Detection Using Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning

## Description
One of the major threats that a nation experiences is a threat resulting from crime. However, prevention of such happenings is a challenging task since a perfect mechanism to detect crime cannot be established due to the dynamic nature of criminal activity. In addition to this, it is difficult for humans to manually process large amounts of criminal data and perform a background check of the same. Therefore, the scenario is opted to be controlled through the computational algorithms wherein crime predictions and forecasting can be made in order to improve the safety of the populace and accurately detect crime rates. Hence, it can be concluded that such problems can be addressed by incorporating advanced technology with manual detection of crime.
